# m3-dreamland

A Material 3 Expressive component library for [dreamland.js](https://github.com/mercuryworkshop/dreamlandjs). Currently doesn't support all the components, see the source for the full list. Most of the components are also showcased with all their twiddles on [m3dl.r58playz.dev](https://m3dl.r58playz.dev) ([m3-dreamland-showcase](https://github.com/r58Playz/m3-dreamland-showcase)).

Inspired by m3-svelte's API. Aims to mostly follow spec, except in places where it's weird or almost impossible to recreate without a lot of JS (like the expressive button group).
